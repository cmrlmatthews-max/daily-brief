# Daily brief

A personal "AI homepage". It is rebuilt once a day and served by GitHub Pages.

Live at https://cmrlmatthews-max.github.io/daily-brief/

## How it works

1. GitHub Actions runs `brief.py` every morning.
2. The script reads the feeds listed in `sources.yaml`.
3. It sends the items to Claude. Claude picks the best ones and writes a short note for each.
4. Claude only returns item ids. The script maps them back to the real titles and links. Unknown ids are dropped, so links are never invented.
5. Team scores come straight from ESPN. No AI is involved.
6. The script writes `site/brief.json`. The page `site/index.html` shows it.

If a run fails, the old page stays live.

## Set up

1. Add a repo secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
2. In Settings > Pages, set the source to GitHub Actions.
3. Run the "Daily brief" workflow once by hand.

## Edit sources

Open `sources.yaml`. Add, remove, or disable sources. Each source has a `name`, a `type`, and a `url`. Types are `rss`, `html_anthropic`, `github_search`, and `espn_news`. Set `enabled: false` to switch one off. Change `reader_profile` to change what Claude cares about.

## Run locally

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... python brief.py
```

Try it without network or an API key:

```
python brief.py --dry-run
```

Fetch feeds only, and write `out/items.json`:

```
python brief.py --fetch-only
```

Then serve the page:

```
cd site && python -m http.server
```
